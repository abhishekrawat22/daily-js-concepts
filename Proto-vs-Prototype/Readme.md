In JavaScript, __proto__ and prototype are related but serve different purposes in the context of objects and inheritance. Here's a detailed explanation of each:

# __proto__
- **Definition:** __proto__ is a property of an object that points to the prototype that the object inherits from. It is essentially a reference to the object's prototype.
- **Usage:** It is used to get or set the prototype of an existing object.
- `let obj = {};
  console.log(obj.__proto__ === Object.prototype); // true`
- **Important Note:** __proto__ is non-standard and should not be used in production code. The recommended way to interact with an object's prototype is through Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf.

# prototype
- **Definition:** prototype is a property of a constructor function (not of objects created by the function). It is used to define properties and methods that should be inherited by instances of the constructor function.
- **Usage:** It is used to set up inheritance and shared properties or methods for all instances created by a constructor function.
- `
  function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }`
  `Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(``Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);`
  `};`

  `let alice = new Person('Alice');
  alice.greet(); // Hello, my name is Alice
  `
- **Important Note:** When you create a new object using a constructor function, the new object’s __proto__ property is set to the constructor’s prototype property. This is what establishes the prototype chain.

## Summary
- __proto__ is an object property that points to the prototype of the object.
- prototype is a property of constructor functions used to define properties and methods that are shared by all instances created by that constructor.
- __proto__ is a way to access or modify an object's prototype, whereas prototype is used to define the prototype for objects created by a constructor function.
- Modern JavaScript recommends using Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf instead of __proto__.
