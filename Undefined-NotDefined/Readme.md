# Undefined

A keyword assigned as a value/placeholder also when a variable is declared as soon in GEC using **var**. In global scope **var a** will be equal to undefined first. And we can access it even before initializing. Do not assign it as a value as it is a bad practice. Undefined is not empty.

# Not Defined

It is shown as an error if a variable is not allocated any memory or declared.
